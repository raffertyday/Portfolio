    ABOUT ME
</h1>
<div className={classes.main}>
<p>
    Hi, I`&apos;`m Raffi, a full-stack web developer passionate about creativity, innovative functionality, and understanding the 
    `&quot;`why`&quot;` and `&quot;`how`&quot;` behind things. Although I`&apos;`ve been coding for only about 6 months, with 3 months focused on full-stack development, 
    I`&apos;`m already captivated by the process of bringing ideas to life. Coding allows me to do this daily, constantly pushing the boundaries 
    of my creativity. I enjoy working with nextJS and react to create innovative fullstack web apps.<br /><br />For most of my life, however, 
    my coding knowledge was limited to a Year 7 Scratch lesson—and I hated it! My true passion was sports, particularly football. 
    I had a ball at my feet before I could walk and spent my entire childhood obsessed with the game. This dream became a reality when 
    Bolton Wanderers Academy scouted me at age 6, but securing that first contract wasn`&apos;`t easy. It took two years of trials before I 
    signed on properly, watching many boys come and go quickly. This experience taught me a crucial life lesson: `&quot;`Just out-work them.`&quot;` 
    It became my mantra—no excuses, just work harder. <br /><br /> To summarize my football journey: I was in the academy system from then on, 
    released by Bolton at 10, signed for Huddersfield Town at 11, and then for Burnley at 12 when Huddersfield`&apos;`s academy shut down. 
    My time at Burnley was my happiest in football, but also the most demanding. As a kid, I balanced six days of training a week, 
    finishing at 9:30 PM each night, getting home by 11, and waking up for school at 7. I missed full days for our weekly Thursday release
    and half days for Wednesday matches, not to mention the countless tournaments that took me away for days. It was challenging to focus on
     anything school-related, but I knew what I wanted and believed I could achieve it.<br /><br /> After several releases and comebacks, 
     I made my first team debut for Halifax Town at 17—a dream come true. Sadly, this triumph was short-lived. The very next day, in a game
      to make up minutes, I suffered a full rupture of my ACL, MCL, and meniscus. It was devastating, plummeting me from cloud nine to rock 
      bottom in hours. Despite this setback, I refused to give up. I had my knee surgically repaired and dedicated a year to recovery. 
      One of my greatest achievements in sport was not just returning from this injury physically, but mentally as well. However, luck
       wasn`&apos;`t on my side. About three months after returning to play, I dislocated my other knee, necessitating another surgery.<br /><br />
        As you can imagine, this was incredibly difficult to accept. Not only did I face another surgery, but complications forced me into 
        an extremely early retirement, leaving me at a loss. I`&apos;`m not sharing this story for pity, but to illustrate what makes me valuable 
        today. I believe I offer a different perspective than the typical university graduate. I`&apos;`ve honed practical skills in leadership,
         teamwork, handling pressure, learning, adaptability, receiving advice and criticism constructively, confidence, and communicating 
         effectively with people of all backgrounds and ages.<br /><br /> What truly sets me apart is my proven track record of consistent 
         hard work and goal achievement in a challenging field. (Fun fact: the odds of a boy playing academy football are 0.5%, and the 
         chances of that boy making his first team debut are just 2% of that 0.5%.) I see this as evidence of my ability to excel in my 
         chosen field—now, that field is coding! <br /><br /> I`&apos;`m not just excited to grow; I expect to improve each day. My aim isn`&apos;`t merely to secure 
         a coding job and get by. I want to learn and develop. The skills I`&apos;`ve acquired in just three months demonstrate not only my ability
          to work hard and develop expertise in an extremely challenging field but also hint at what I could achieve given an opportunity 
          and time. While I may not be the most qualified candidate on paper, I truly believe my work ethic, faith in Christ, and desire for
           continuous improvement set me apart. I wouldn`&apos;`t enter a workplace expecting to know everything; rather, I`&apos;`d aim to learn from 
           those more experienced than myself, bringing a humility i feel is lost in this day and age. I do not desire to be the smartest 
           in the room, then there is nothing to learn.
